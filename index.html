            <h5>My name is Madison Clark and I am a sophomore in the SFS studying STIA (Science Technology in International Affairs) with a concentration in technology and security. I'm particularly interested in game development and would like to learn more about the backend and frontend process that goes into developing games such as The Last of Us or The Walking Dead (TellTales Series). In the future, I hope to take the knowledge that I will learn now and throughout my years in college to start a career in game development with different gaming companies.</h5>
